# Hi
Few notes before you dive into the code:
## Features
- highlight of cell when clicked
- when 5 or more element of any fibonacci sequence are found, highlight of the cells and reset of values
- examples unit tests
- really basic scss styling

## Time spent
6hrs

## Thoughts
The assignment has a challenging algorithm (Fibonacci on a matrix) and its whole logic has been located in one file.
When it comes to the display of such matrix, all the logic has been delegated to the board component, which implements the cell dummy component.
Such logic can be further abstracted from the board, creating more MVC style, but for the sake of simplicity all reside there.
Also, the styling on a Fibonacci match can be simplified into a unique data structure.

# Getting started
- Install packages: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm start`
- Run unit test suit: `npm test`

Looking forward to your feedback,
Thanks!
